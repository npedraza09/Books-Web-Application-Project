### 2.1 Folders

#### 1. Application

Although this is not a folder, the application file is on its own, separate from the other folders but under the project folder that encapsulates everything. This file is written with Python and is the main component of the web app. It integrates everything to successfully create the streamlined platform.

#### 2. Templates Folder

This folder includes all HTML files that have templates for different parts of the web app. These templates are referenced on the app.py to integrate and build the web app. 

#### 3. Static Folder

The static folder does not have much to it other than the images in png format for the books. This folder is created for simplicity when listing and referencing each book to its corresponding image, especially when a book and image are added by a user on their account.
